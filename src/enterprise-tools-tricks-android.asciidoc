== Objectives

* What tools to look at when growing

* Find out about some great libraries and tools

* 


Have you been developing Android applications for a while? On your
own? And there is just too much to do? Congratulations! But what next?
Android application development is growing up, and larger and larger
teams are working on multiple mobile applications. And these
applications have to tie back into one or many server-side enterprise
applications. The complexity of a typical Android application requires
the use of a number of external libraries for interoperating with Web
services and other systems; abstracting the Android API across
platform versions; improving the performance or maintainability of the
source code; and many more aspects. Learn about a number of great
libraries available as open source, where to get them, and how to
start including them into your application easily.

As a next step, we will learn about repository management. Learn how
to enjoy great build performance and stability, and how to gain access
to an easy mechanism to distribute your own libraries and components
internally as well as to partners and clients. Once you are using a
repository manager, you will be able to easily distribute your
applications across teams and potentially implement a multi-stage
release process with notifications and rollbacks, if necessary.

Using all these libraries brings tremendous benefits to you. It
however also means that you are responsible for license compliance,
and we will show you some accepted practices for ensuring that your
applications comply. Unfortunately, these components can be affected
by security issues as well. We will examine the ideas of Component
Lifecycle Management, and check out some of the tools available to
help you take control over potential security and license issues.

Once your development efforts scale even further, you will need to
examine your version-control system usage. We will look at a few
practices for using branches effectively and ensuring that development
efforts on multiple features integrate well. Adding a continuous
integration server into your development infrastructure will allow you
tie everything together.

== What is Our Scenario? 

You are somewhere along the path from 

* a small company

** one or two, up to a handful of people

* with a successful app

* and maybe a server side backend

to

* a larger company

** dozens to thousands of people

* with multiple applications

** probably on multiple platforms

* and a large server backend system  

*Congratulations! You will see, it is an exciting ride!*

== What We *Will Not* Talk About...

Growing a company means that you have dedicated people for things like

* Finance

* HR

* Sales

* Marketing

* ...

but we will *not* cover all those aspects. 

== What We *Will* Talk About...

Growing a software development team means things like

* more specialization 

** dedicated QA

** dedicated backend developers

** dedicated app developers (per platform potentially)

** and yes, dedicated managers (or at least people with part time
   management duties) 

* more formalization of procedures, hopefully agile!

** XP, SCRUM, Kanban

** hopefully not waterfall...

** there is an entire industry around for that stuff -> be careful

* more *development infrastructure and tooling*

** this will be our focus

** so more details coming later  image:images/emoticons/wink.png[scale=100]


== Big Picture Things to Consider

There are a lot of other aspects.. 

* I found the following to be often overlooked or merely evolving 

* rather than being a conscious decision 

* which makes it harder to change

== Big Picture Things to Consider

What to consider and think about ..

* Distributed company? 

** affects culture of communication and interaction

** wider choice of people

** virtual infrastructure

* What is your core competency?

** if it is not website creation - don't start coding your own

** same for finance, marketing, HR and so on

** but in the beginning you will have to do lots of different things
   yourself

** and when you are very large you might want to control some of them

TIP: Choose wisely what you take care of yourself, and what you pay
others to do for you!


== Let's move on to

*Software Development*

and 

*Related Tooling*

== Simple App Development 

Used to be like this:: 

* simple codebase

* one project

* Eclipse used to build and release app on developer machine

* manual QA

* manual upload to app store

* application not internationalized (i18n)

* no server backend system integrated

* one target form factor (phone)

== Complex App Development - Codebase

And now...

* complex app code

* multiple external libraries (components) 

* multiple internal compornents used

* components used across server backend and mobile app

* multiple apps

* multiple target form factors

** phone, tablet, TV, desktop and others
 

== Complex App Development - Building

* Eclipse, Intellij and others used by developers

* Command line build becomes important

* Release build on "build machine" -> Continuous integration server usage


== Complex App Development - People

Now a lot more people are involved

* developers

* testers

* managers

** unavoidable, but stay nimble

* writers

** don't forget documentation!

== Complex App Development - How? 

*With all these complexities, how can you manage all that?*

* formalization and standarization of procedures

* tooling


== Formalization of Procedures - The Problem

* cowboy coding

* rampant choice and therefore complexity

* no testing

* ad hoc deployments to production

* fixing things right in prodcution 

-> These things do not fly anymore --  the stakes are too high

== Formalization of Procedures - The Benefits

* avoid communication issues and other friction

* provide stability for users and yourself

* easier for new people as well 

* produce higher quality apps

* avoid huge costs of failure


== Formalization of Procedures - Agile 

* IT is very fast paced.

* Mobile is even faster.

* You have to keep up to compete

->  You have to use some sort of agile process

== We Don't Need "Agile"!

Often a sentiment found typically in 

* regulated sectors like health

* government 

* or other slower market

->Using agile methodologies will give you an edge over your
  competitors

== Tips For Introduction

Just some quick tips

* Don't be religious about following one method

* Don't buy into the money milking machine

* But get help to find your own way

* Make it part of the company culture

IMPORTANT: A lot of this should be common sense.


== Tools Beyond Development 

You will need these to some extent and they do affect development.

* Customer Relationship Management 

** goes beyond using the play console

* Website

** parts might have to be embedded in your application

* User interaction tools like forums, mailing lists, support systems,
  issue tracker

* Bookkeeping, Inventory,  - order management, in app payments integration

TIP: You might have to integrate with or use them, but we will not
focus on these.

== Development Tools You Will Need

Directly used by development

* Issue tracker
 
** for internal use

** and potentially customer usage

* Version control system

** distributed or centralized

** maybe some of your components are open source

IMPORTANT: Imho these are a *must have*!  Do we need to discuss why?

== Development Tools You Might Want

For your development you might want

* Build system

** to be able to automate your build

* Quality Metrics and Analysis Tools

** taking care of your own code

* Testing Facilities and Tools

** making sure code does what it is intended to

* Continuous Integration Server

** making sure things work all the time

* Repository Manager

** store all your internal and external components 

** provide build performance and stability

* Component Lifecycle Management

** for security and license analysis and monitoring of components

IMPORTANT: Which are a must have will depend on who you ask, but imho
you need them all  image:images/emoticons/wink.png[scale=100]


== Tooling

Get something off the shelf or write your own? 

* Do NOT reinvent the wheel, just because you can

* These system are all simple, but only on the surface!

* Maybe write some glue code for integrating different systems



* Focus on your business, not your tools!



== Tooling Infrastructure

Where and who to run it all?

* Depends on the company structure

** distributed or not, how many locations...

* Who controls hardware

** you might need access e.g. for attaching hardware devices

* Where is it located 

** your own datacenter

** provider

** potentially legal restrictions for location (

* Saas, Paas or DIY

** Software as a Service

** Platform as a Service

** Do it yourself
